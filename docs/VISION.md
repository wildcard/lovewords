## What LoveWords Is

LoveWords is a communication product for AAC users and their families. It helps a person who can't rely on speech quickly express relationship language—love, gratitude, comfort, apology, and connection—using simple, dependable communication boards and phrases.

This is not another general-purpose AAC app. This is a tool built around a specific truth: **the words that matter most are often the hardest to find.**

---

## Mission Statement

**Give every AAC user an easy, dignified way to express heartfelt connection—especially the words that matter most to family.**

---

## Who LoveWords Is For

**Primary users:**
- AAC users who want fast access to relationship language
- Nonspeaking and minimally speaking autistic people
- Individuals with developmental disabilities, cerebral palsy, apraxia, or acquired conditions affecting speech
- Anyone who needs support expressing emotion, not just needs

**The people around them:**
- Parents, siblings, partners, and extended family
- Caregivers and personal assistants
- Speech-language pathologists and therapists
- Educators and school staff

## Why Build Yet Another AAC Program?

### 1. Relationship-First Communication

Many AAC tools are excellent at needs: *eat, drink, bathroom, help.* These words are essential—but they're not the whole story.

LoveWords starts from connection:
- *"I love you"*
- *"I miss you"*
- *"Thank you"*
- *"I'm proud of you"*
- *"I'm scared"*
- *"Stay with me"*

This emotional vocabulary can be life-changing for families who have waited years to hear these words.

### 2. Lowest-Friction Experience

Families need something that works immediately. No complex configuration. No weeks of setup. No steep learning curve.

LoveWords should feel welcoming and obvious from the first tap. A parent should be able to hand it to their child and watch them say *"I love you, grandma"* within minutes.

### 3. Board Portability and Openness

Communication boards should be shareable, remixable, and not locked inside one vendor's ecosystem.

LoveWords is open source. Your boards belong to you. Export them, share them, adapt them, take them anywhere.

### 4. Privacy and Trust

Families deserve a tool that doesn't monetize sensitive communication. The words between a parent and child are sacred.

Our default stance:
- Privacy-first
- Minimal data collection
- Transparent behavior
- No accounts required
- Works offline

### 5. Designed with Real Moments in Mind

We build for the moments where communication matters most:
- **Mother's Day:** When a child wants to say something special
- **Bedtime:** Comfort words and "I love you" before sleep
- **First day of school:** Reassurance for anxious mornings
- **After a meltdown:** "I'm sorry" and "I still love you"
- **After care:** "Thank you for helping me"
- **Missing someone:** "I wish you were here"

These moments need the right words, quickly, without pressure.

# The Elevator Pitches

## Short Pitch (2-3 sentences)

LoveWords helps AAC users say what matters most: *I love you. I'm sorry. Thank you. I miss you.* It's a free, open-source communication tool built around relationship language—the words that connect families. Simple enough to use in seconds, personal enough to feel like home.

---

## Long Pitch (Landing Page Version)

Every family has moments when words matter most. The first "I love you." The bedtime "goodnight" that means "you're safe." The "I'm sorry" that repairs a hard day. The "I miss you" that bridges distance.

For families with AAC users—people who communicate through symbols, boards, or devices rather than speech—these moments can be harder to reach. Many AAC tools focus on needs: *eat, drink, bathroom, help.* Essential words, but not the whole story.

**LoveWords is different.** We start from connection.

LoveWords is a free, open-source communication tool designed specifically for relationship language: love, gratitude, comfort, apology, and reassurance. It's built for the moments that matter—bedtime, goodbyes, celebrations, overwhelm, reconciliation, and missing someone.

No complex setup. No weeks of configuration. No expensive subscriptions. Just a warm, simple tool that helps a child say "I love you, mom" in seconds.

We believe communication is a human right—and that includes the words that bind us together. LoveWords is made by and for the AAC community, with privacy-first defaults, open and portable boards, and a commitment to staying free forever.

**Because everyone deserves to be heard. Especially when it matters most.**
