**Date**: January 2026
**Status**: Strategic Planning Complete ✅
**Next Phase**: Begin Implementation (Phase 1: Switch Scanning)

---

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

**Mission**: Empower non-verbal adults to express love, affection, and intimate communication through a free, accessible, relationship-focused AAC tool.

**Vision**: Become the go-to free AAC solution for relationship communication, filling the gap between expensive premium apps ($150-$300) and generic free alternatives.

---

## 📊 Market Opportunity

### Current Market State

| Segment | Price Range | Examples | Gap |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----|
| **Premium** | $150-$300 | Proloquo2Go ($249), TouchChat ($149.99) | Expensive, generic vocabulary |
| **Free/Open Source** | $0 | CBoard, LetMeTalk, Grid Player | Basic features, no relationship focus |
| **LoveWords** | **$0** | **LoveWords** | **Free + Premium Features + Relationship Focus** ✨ |

### Key Market Insights

1. **Affordability Crisis**: 10/10 users cited cost as top barrier (premium apps cost $150-$300)
2. **Adult User Neglect**: Most AAC apps designed for children, not adults in relationships
3. **Switch Access Gap**: Critical accessibility feature missing from free alternatives
4. **Customization Demand**: Users want personalized vocabulary, not generic phrases
5. **Open Source Opportunity**: Only CBoard (UNICEF) offers open source web AAC

**LoveWords Opportunity**: Be the first free, relationship-focused, web-based AAC tool with premium accessibility features.

## 🔄 Ralph Loop - Continuous Improvement

### Sprint-Level Loop (2 weeks)
```
Week 1:
  Monday:    Sprint Planning → Select features from roadmap
  Tue-Thu:   Build features (TDD)
  Friday:    PR reviews, merge

Week 2:
  Mon-Wed:   Build features
  Thursday:  Sprint Review (demo) + Internal testing
  Friday:    Sprint Retro (learn) + Deploy + Triage issues

→ Repeat
```

### Phase-Level Loop (3 months)
```
Month 1-2: Build features (Sprint 1-4)
Month 3:
  Week 1:  Recruit user testers
  Week 2:  Run user testing sessions
  Week 3:  Analyze results (transcribe, metrics, themes)
  Week 4:  Fix P0 issues, update roadmap, blog post

→ Repeat for next phase
```

### Agent-Assisted Iteration
**Use agents to accelerate development**:
- **Planning**: `architect` (design), `plan-reviewer` (review)
- **Building**: `kraken` (TDD implementation), `spark` (quick fixes)
- **Testing**: `arbiter` (run tests), `critic` (code review), `aegis` (security)
- **Learning**: `session-analyst` (analyze feedback), `chronicler` (store learnings)

**Example Workflow** (Phase 1, Sprint 1):
```bash
# Planning
architect: "Design single-switch scanning feature"
plan-reviewer: "Review switch scanning plan"

# Building
kraken: "Implement switch scanning with TDD"

# Testing
arbiter: "Run all tests"
critic: "Review code quality and accessibility"
aegis: "Security audit"

# Learning
session-analyst: "Analyze sprint results"
chronicler: "Store learnings: switch scanning implementation"
```
