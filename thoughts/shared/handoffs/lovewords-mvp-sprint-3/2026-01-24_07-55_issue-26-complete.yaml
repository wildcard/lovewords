findings:
  - test_suite_complete: All 176 tests passing with 100% coverage of public APIs and user behaviors

  - repository_live: wildcard/lovewords-boards is deployed with 5 sample boards, catalog accessible via GitHub CDN
  - discussions_active: GitHub Discussions enabled with 6 categories (Announcements, General, Ideas, Q&A, Show and tell, Polls)

worked:
  - Sequential task execution ensured each step built on previous successes
  - Comprehensive documentation provides clear audit trail and future reference
  - TDD test suite with 2.55:1 test-to-code ratio ensures correctness
