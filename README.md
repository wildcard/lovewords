# LoveWords

**Communication is a human right. LoveWords exists to make it accessible to everyone.**

LoveWords is a free, open-source Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) application designed to give voice to those who communicate differently. Whether you're a child learning to express yourself, an adult navigating aphasia, or a caregiver supporting a loved one, LoveWords is here for you.

## Our Mission

> *Every person deserves to be heard, understood, and connected.*

LoveWords is built on a simple belief: the ability to communicate shouldn't depend on your income, location, or the device you own. We're creating AAC software that is **free forever**, **works offline**, and **adapts to the unique needs of every user**.

This isn't just an app. It's a bridge between thoughts and expression, between isolation and connection, between silence and being truly heard.

---

## Core Pillars

### 1. Free & Open Source
Communication tools shouldn't cost thousands of dollars. LoveWords is and always will be free, licensed under GPL-3.0. The code belongs to the community, ensuring no one can lock away access to something so fundamental.

### 2. Privacy First
Your words are yours. LoveWords works completely offline. No accounts required. No data collection. No tracking. What you communicate stays between you and the people you're talking to.

### 3. Truly Accessible
Built from the ground up with accessibility as a core feature, not an afterthought. We support switch scanning, eye gaze integration, touch, and keyboard navigation. LoveWords adapts to you, not the other way around.

### 4. Customizable & Personal
Every communicator is unique. LoveWords offers deep customization: create your own symbol boards, record personal voice messages, adjust layouts, colors, and interaction methods. Your communication tool should feel like *yours*.

### 5. Community Driven
Built by and for the AAC community. We actively involve AAC users, speech-language pathologists, caregivers, and families in every stage of development. Nothing about us without us.

## Who Is LoveWords For?

LoveWords is designed for anyone who needs support with verbal communication:

- **Children** with autism, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, or developmental delays who are learning to communicate
- **Adults** experiencing acquired conditions like ALS, stroke, aphasia, or traumatic brain injury
- **Individuals** with selective mutism, social anxiety, or who are non-speaking by choice
- **Temporary users** recovering from surgery, illness, or injury affecting speech
- **Caregivers & families** supporting loved ones on their communication journey
- **Speech-language pathologists** and educators seeking quality tools for their clients and students

Whether communication support is a lifelong need or a temporary bridge, LoveWords is here.

## Why LoveWords? What Makes Us Different

The AAC landscape has long been dominated by expensive proprietary software and locked ecosystems. Here's why we're building something different:

| Challenge | LoveWords Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Cost barrier** | Completely free. No subscriptions. No premium tiers. No hidden costs. |
| **Internet dependency** | Works 100% offline. Use it anywhere: home, school, outdoors, hospitals. |
| **Privacy concerns** | Zero data collection. No accounts. Your communication is private. |
| **Limited customization** | Deep personalization options. Create symbols, record voices, design layouts. |
| **Platform lock-in** | Cross-platform: web, mobile, desktop. Your boards go where you go. |
| **Complex interfaces** | Clean, intuitive design. Easy setup for caregivers. Grows with the user. |
| **Isolated development** | Community-driven. AAC users shape the roadmap. |

### Our Commitment

We will never:
- Charge for core functionality
- Sell or monetize user data
- Create artificial limitations to push upgrades
- Abandon the project or make it proprietary
