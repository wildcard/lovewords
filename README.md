# LoveWords

> *"Find the words to say 'I love you, mom.'"*

**LoveWords** is a free, open-source AAC tool for the words that matter most: love, gratitude, comfort, apology, and connection.

---

## Mission

**Give every AAC user an easy, dignified way to express heartfelt connection—especially the words that matter most to family.**

---

## Who It's For

- **AAC users** who want fast access to relationship language—including nonspeaking and minimally speaking autistic people
- **Families** who want to hear "I love you," "thank you," and "I'm sorry" from someone they love
- **Therapists, educators, and caregivers** who support emotional expression and connection

---

## Why LoveWords?

### Relationship-First
Many AAC tools focus on needs: *eat, drink, help.* LoveWords starts from connection: *I love you. I miss you. Thank you. I'm proud of you.* The emotional vocabulary that changes families.

### Works Immediately
No complex setup. No weeks of configuration. A parent should be able to hand this to their child and watch them say "I love you, grandma" in minutes.

### Open and Portable
Your boards belong to you. Export them, share them, remix them. No vendor lock-in. No proprietary formats.

### Private by Default
No accounts required. No tracking. Works offline. The words between you and your family stay between you.

### Designed for Real Moments
Bedtime. Goodbyes. Apologies. Celebrations. Missing someone. We build for the moments when the right words matter most.
